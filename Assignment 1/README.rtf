\f0\fs24 \cf0 Open Assignment1.py. The structure of the code is formatted with several helper functions answering individual question parts, with the main code at the very bottom where the user can control which questions should be run. Each question is initially set to False, but can be set to True if the user wants to run that particular question. Questions 1 and 3 call each dataset separately, so if only one needs to be run to check code integrity while saving time, simply comment out the larger datasets. \
